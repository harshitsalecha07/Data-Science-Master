    "A database is an organized collection of structured data that is stored and managed electronically. It provides a way to store, retrieve, update, and manipulate data efficiently. Databases are commonly used in various applications and systems, ranging from small-scale applications to large enterprise systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that handle data storage and retrieval in different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on a relational model, which organizes data into tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data. SQL databases have the following characteristics:\n",
    "Structured: Data is stored in predefined tables with a fixed schema. Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields).\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases enforce a predefined schema, which defines the structure and relationships between tables.\n",
    "ACID properties: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. SQL databases ensure these properties to maintain data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "Strong data consistency: SQL databases typically provide strong data consistency, meaning that data is always in a valid state according to the defined constraints.\n",
    "Suitable for complex transactions: SQL databases excel in handling complex transactions involving multiple related tables.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly changing data. They provide a flexible schema that allows data to be stored in various formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, columnar, or graphs. NoSQL databases have the following characteristics:\n",
    "Flexible schema: NoSQL databases allow dynamic schemas, enabling the storage of heterogeneous data without predefined structure.\n",
    "Scalability and performance: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, making them suitable for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "Eventual consistency: NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and scalability over strong data consistency, which means that data consistency might be achieved over time.\n",
    "Support for distributed architectures: NoSQL databases are well-suited for distributed environments and can handle data across multiple servers or clusters.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.\n",
    "It's important to note that both SQL and NoSQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the application or system at hand."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting database objects. DDL statements are used to define the schema, tables, indexes, constraints, and other structural components of a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used DDL statements and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create database objects such as tables, views, indexes, or stored procedures. It specifies the name of the object, its structure, and any constraints. Here's an example of creating a table in SQL:\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "  age INT,\n",
    "  department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "This statement creates a table named \"employees\" with columns for id, name, age, and department.\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP:\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to remove database objects, such as tables, views, or indexes. It permanently deletes the object and all associated data. Here's an example of dropping a table:\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "This statement removes the \"employees\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or other properties. Here's an example of altering a table:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN salary DECIMAL(10, 2);\n",
    "This statement adds a new column named \"salary\" with a decimal data type to the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, but keeps the table structure intact. It is faster than deleting rows one by one using the DELETE statement. Here's an example of truncating a table:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "This statement removes all rows from the \"employees\" table, but the table structure remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL statements are essential for defining and managing the structure of a database, allowing developers and administrators to create, modify, and remove database objects as needed to support the application or system requirements."

    "This statement inserts a new row into the \"employees\" table with the values 1, 'John Doe', 30, and 'Sales' for the id, name, age, and department columns, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE:\n",
    "The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns based on specified conditions. Here's an example of updating data in a table:\n",
    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET age = 31\n",

    "Referential integrity: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the corresponding primary key column(s) of the referenced table. This prevents orphaned or inconsistent data.\n",
