    "There are several methods used for web scraping, depending on the complexity of the task and the structure of the website being scraped. Here are some commonly used methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manual Copy-Pasting: The simplest method involves manually copying and pasting data from websites into a local file or spreadsheet. While this method works for small-scale scraping tasks, it is time-consuming and not suitable for large-scale data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular Expressions (Regex): Regular expressions are patterns used to match and extract specific data from text. They can be used to extract data from HTML source code by matching patterns and capturing the desired information. Regex is a powerful method for simple scraping tasks, but it can become complex and fragile when dealing with more complex HTML structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML Parsing: HTML parsing involves using libraries or frameworks, such as BeautifulSoup in Python, to parse and navigate through the HTML structure of web pages. These libraries provide tools to locate specific elements, extract data, and traverse the HTML tree structure. HTML parsing is a widely used method for web scraping due to its flexibility and ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "XPath: XPath is a language used for querying and extracting data from XML and HTML documents. It allows you to specify the location of elements in a structured way, making it easier to extract specific data. XPath is often used in combination with HTML parsing libraries to target and extract data from web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping Frameworks: There are various web scraping frameworks available that provide higher-level abstractions and simplify the scraping process. These frameworks, such as Scrapy in Python, provide built-in functionality for making HTTP requests, handling cookies, managing sessions, and extracting data from websites. They offer a more organized and scalable approach to web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headless Browsers: Headless browsers, such as Puppeteer or Selenium, allow you to automate web browsing and interact with websites programmatically. They simulate a real browser environment, enabling you to scrape websites that rely heavily on JavaScript for rendering content. Headless browsers can handle dynamic content, perform form submissions, and extract data from web pages as if a human user were interacting with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has its advantages and is suitable for different scraping scenarios. The choice of method depends on factors such as the complexity of the website, the desired data, and the programming language or tools being used for scraping.\n",
