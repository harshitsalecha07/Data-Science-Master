    "### Q2.) Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "###### The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Encapsulation: It refers to the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data, into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation enables data hiding, which means that the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world and can be accessed only through publicly exposed methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Inheritance: It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that inherits from it is called the subclass or child class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and makes it easier to create and maintain a large codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Polymorphism: It refers to the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading, which allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, and method overriding, which allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Abstraction: It involves the process of identifying the essential features of an object and ignoring the rest. Abstraction enables the creation of abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a blueprint for implementing concrete classes. Abstraction also helps in reducing code complexity and improving code maintainability.\n"
